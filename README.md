Idea & Architecture:

Step 1: Encoded 700 Shloks meanings through Sentence to Vector transformation.

Step 2: Built 18 Annoy indices on preprocessed data.

Step 3: Transformed natural language queries into vector format.

Step 4: Leveraged indices for optimzing selection of top solution shloks' meanings, ensuring the utmost relevance.

Currently supporting both Hindi and English versions.

Wishing everyone a joyous Geeta Jayanti. May the teachings of the Shrimad Bhagavad Gita continue to inspire and guide us all. 🙏

It's like having a personal guide through the sacred verses!
